## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-22 - **Dynamic Rental Duration System** üéØ

Major enhancement to invoice functionality with intelligent rental duration management and automated quantity adjustments.

### Added

- **Dynamic Rental Duration Calculation**:
  - `calculateRentalDuration()` function computes days between Load-In and Load-Out dates
  - Uses `Math.ceil()` to round up partial days to full rental days
  - Displays formatted result: "1 Day" or "X Days"
  - Minimum 1-day rental enforced
  - Returns default of 1 day when dates not set

- **Rental Duration Field**:
  - Read-only input field with gray background (`#f5f5f5`)
  - Auto-updates when Load-In or Load-Out dates change
  - Located in Event Details section
  - Visual indicator that field is calculated (not manually editable)

- **Intelligent Quantity Management System**:
  - `updateLineItemQuantities()` function adjusts all line items based on rental duration
  - **Daily-Scaled Services** (qty = rental days):
    - LED Kit batches
    - Video Processing & Control System
    - Power Distribution
    - Rigging & Support Structure
    - Insurance & Equipment Coverage
  - **Fixed-Quantity Services**:
    - Transportation & Logistics: qty = 2 (delivery + pickup)
    - Content Management & Testing: qty = 1 (one-time service)
    - On-Site Technical Support: qty = 8 hours (not affected by rental days)
  - Keyword-based service identification for flexible line item descriptions
  - Automatic re-rendering and recalculation after quantity updates

- **Real-Time Event Listeners**:
  - `change` event listeners on Load-In date input
  - `change` event listeners on Load-Out date input
  - Triggers `updateLineItemQuantities()` on any date change
  - Auto-saves draft after each update
  - Provides instant feedback without manual refresh

- **Clear Dates Button**:
  - Red button in Event Details header (`#ff6b6b` background)
  - `clearEventDates()` function clears all date fields
  - Resets quantities to appropriate defaults:
    - Daily-scaled services ‚Üí qty = 1
    - Transportation ‚Üí qty = 2 (maintained)
    - Content Management ‚Üí qty = 1 (maintained)
    - Tech Support ‚Üí qty = 8 hours (maintained)
  - Rounded corners and hover styling
  - Positioned with float: right for easy access

### Changed

- **addKit() Function**:
  - Now uses `calculateRentalDuration()` for initial quantity
  - New LED kits added with current rental days as quantity
  - Changed from hardcoded qty = 1

- **addAddon() Function**:
  - Service-type-aware quantity assignment
  - Checks serviceId to determine appropriate initial quantity
  - Transportation: qty = 2
  - On-site tech: qty = 8 (or service.qty if defined)
  - Content management: qty = 1
  - All others: qty = rental days

- **Page Load Initialization**:
  - Calls `calculateRentalDuration()` on page load
  - Ensures rental duration displays correct value for saved invoices
  - Initializes before first render

### Technical Details

- **Date Handling**: Uses HTML5 `datetime-local` inputs with JavaScript Date objects
- **Calculation Method**: `(loadOut - loadIn) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)` for milliseconds to days conversion
- **Service Identification**: Case-insensitive keyword matching in line item descriptions
- **State Management**: Maintains consistent state across renders, calculations, and saves
- **File Size**: 1054 lines (increased from previous version due to new functions)

### Files Modified

- `pixelwerx_invoice_videowall_v2.html` - Main invoice file with all enhancements
  - Added version metadata in header comment block
  - Lines 540-565: `calculateRentalDuration()`
  - Lines 567-610: `updateLineItemQuantities()`
  - Lines 616-640: `clearEventDates()`
  - Lines 488-489: Event listeners
  - Line 221: Read-only rental duration field
  - Line 215: Clear Dates button

### Testing Verified

- ‚úÖ 14-day rental (Oct 23 to Nov 5) calculates correctly
- ‚úÖ All daily-scaled services update to qty = 14
- ‚úÖ Transportation maintains qty = 2
- ‚úÖ Content Management maintains qty = 1
- ‚úÖ Tech Support maintains qty = 8
- ‚úÖ Clear button empties all date fields
- ‚úÖ Clear button resets quantities to appropriate defaults
- ‚úÖ Invoice totals recalculate correctly
- ‚úÖ localStorage auto-save works with new features
