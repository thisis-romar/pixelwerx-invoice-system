## üö® Problem Summary

**Error Message:**
```
Exception: No HTML file named Invoice was found.
at Code:330:25
```

**Root Cause:**  
The HTML template file `INVOICE.HTML` exists in your local file system but has **not been uploaded** to the Google Apps Script project. Google Apps Script cannot access local files - the HTML template must be part of the Apps Script project itself.

**Impact:**  
All invoice generation functions fail:
- Generate PDF for selected row ‚ùå
- Generate + Email for selected row ‚ùå
- Generate by InvoiceId ‚ùå

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Apps Script Editor

1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ucI62Y01XIbXMB36EBLQUkLbQqD11fJuTNE9InbtAqY/edit
2. Click **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. You should see `CODE.GS` in the Files list

### Step 2: Add HTML File

1. In the Apps Script editor, click the **"+"** button next to **Files** (left sidebar)
2. Select **"HTML"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Important:** Name the file exactly **`Invoice`** (capital I, lowercase nvoice)
   - Google Apps Script will automatically add the `.html` extension
   - Final name will show as `Invoice.html` in the file list
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 3: Paste Template Content

1. Open the local file `INVOICE.HTML` (the one in your workspace)
2. Copy **ALL** the content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. In the Apps Script editor, select the new `Invoice.html` file
4. **Delete** all placeholder content
5. **Paste** the copied content (Ctrl+V)
6. **Save** (Ctrl+S or File ‚Üí Save)

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Your Apps Script project should now have **2 files**:
- ‚úÖ `CODE.GS` (the script)
- ‚úÖ `Invoice.html` (the template)

### Test 1: Run Setup (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Apps Script editor, select function dropdown: **`setupWorkbook`**
2. Click **Run** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è button)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Sheet not found" Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Cannot find Invoices tab (tried: Invoices, Invoice, invoices)
```

**Solution:**
1. Run `setupWorkbook` function from Apps Script editor
2. OR manually create sheets with exact names: `Invoices`, `LineItems`, `Clients`, `Settings`
3. Ensure headers match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Alternative:** Use Settings sheet to override tab names:
```
Key: Tab.Invoices
Value: Your_Custom_Tab_Name
```

---

### Issue 2: Logo Not Displaying in PDF

**Symptoms:**
- PDF generates successfully but logo is missing/broken

**Possible Causes:**
1. `LogoUrl` in Settings is empty or invalid
2. Image URL is not publicly accessible
3. Image URL requires authentication

**Solution:**
1. Use a publicly accessible image URL (GitHub raw content, Imgur, Google Drive with public sharing)
2. Current default: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thisis-romar/pixelwerx-video-walls/main/logo.png`
3. Test URL by opening in incognito browser window

---

### Issue 3: Tax Calculation Incorrect

**Symptoms:**
- Tax amount doesn't match expected percentage

**Causes:**
1. `TaxProfiles` in Settings has wrong JSON format
2. `TaxProfile` in Invoice row doesn't match a key in TaxProfiles
3. Line items `Taxable` column has wrong values

**Solution:**
1. Check Settings ‚Üí TaxProfiles = `{"HST_ON":0.13,"NO_TAX":0}`
2. In Invoice row, set TaxProfile = `HST_ON` (must match key exactly)
3. In LineItems, set Taxable = `TRUE` or `FALSE` (case-insensitive)
4. Tax only applies to items where Taxable = TRUE

**Example:**
```
Invoice: TaxProfile = "HST_ON"
Settings: TaxProfiles = {"HST_ON":0.13,"GST":0.05,"NO_TAX":0}
LineItem 1: Qty=1, Rate=1000, Taxable=TRUE  ‚Üí adds $130 tax
LineItem 2: Qty=1, Rate=500,  Taxable=FALSE ‚Üí adds $0 tax
Total Tax: $130
```

---

### Issue 4: Email Not Sending

**Symptoms:**
- PDF generates but email doesn't send
- No error message shown

**Check These:**
1. Client sheet has valid email address
2. Apps Script has Gmail permissions (authorize on first run)
3. Check _Logs sheet for "emailSkipped" warnings

**Common Log Messages:**
```
emailSkipped: missing client.Email
```
**Solution:** Add email address to Clients sheet

```
emailSent: to client@example.com
```
**Success:** Email was sent

---

### Issue 5: "InvoiceId not found" Error

**Symptoms:**
```
Not found: "INV001"
Check that it exists in the Invoices sheet.
```

**Causes:**
1. InvoiceId or InvoiceNo doesn't match exactly
2. Sheet lookup is case-sensitive for data (not tab names)
3. Extra spaces in cell values

**Solution:**
1. Check spelling/capitalization of InvoiceId
2. The script normalizes keys: removes non-alphanumeric, converts to uppercase, replaces 'O' with '0'
3. Examples that match:
   - `INV001` = `inv001` = `INV-001` = `INV 001`
   - `PW2025001` = `pw-2025-001` = `PW 2025 001`

---

### Issue 6: Authorization/Permission Errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Authorization required
The script requires authorization to access your data
```

**First-Time Setup:**
1. Click **Review Permissions**
2. Choose your Google account
3. Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to [Project Name] (unsafe)**
4. Click **Allow**

**Required Permissions:**
- View and manage spreadsheets
- View and manage your Drive files
- Send email on your behalf (for email function)

**Security Note:**
This is YOUR script in YOUR Google account. The "unsafe" warning appears because the script is not verified by Google (it's a custom script, not a published add-on). It's safe to authorize your own scripts.

## üìä Understanding the Log Sheet

The `_Logs` sheet tracks all operations. Use it to debug issues.

**Columns:**
- **Time:** Timestamp of operation
- **Level:** INFO (success), WARN (warning), ERROR (failure)
- **Scope:** Function name (e.g., generateInvoicePdfById)
- **Message:** Status (start, ok, fail)
- **DataJSON:** Detailed data (parameters, results, errors)
- **Ms:** Execution time in milliseconds

**Example Log Entries:**

**Success:**
```
Time: 2025-10-20 14:30:15
Level: INFO
Scope: generateInvoicePdfById
Message: ok
DataJSON: {"invoiceId":"INV001","invoiceNo":"PW-2025-0001","client":"Test Client Inc.","totals":{"subtotal":2500,"tax":325,"total":2825}}
Ms: 3842
```

**Failure:**
```
Time: 2025-10-20 14:27:23
Level: ERROR
Scope: generateInvoicePdfById
Message: fail
DataJSON: {"err":"Exception: No HTML file named Invoice was found.","stack":"..."}
Ms: 5837
```

**How to Use Logs:**
1. Sort by Time (descending) to see recent operations
2. Filter by Level = ERROR to find failures
3. Check DataJSON for detailed error messages
4. Compare successful vs failed operations

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Tab Names

If your sheets have different names, add overrides to Settings:

```
Key: Tab.Invoices
Value: Your_Invoices_Sheet_Name

Key: Tab.LineItems
Value: Your_Items_Sheet_Name

Key: Tab.Clients
Value: Your_Clients_Sheet_Name
```

**Tab Name Aliases (Work Automatically):**
- Invoices: `Invoice`, `Invoices`, `invoice`, `invoices`
- LineItems: `Line Items`, `Lineitems`, `Lineltems`, `Items`
- Clients: `Client`, `Clients`

### Custom Output Folder

By default, PDFs save to Drive root. To organize them:

1. Create a folder in Google Drive (e.g., "PixelWerx Invoices")
2. Open the folder
3. Copy the folder ID from URL:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ABC...XYZ
                                           ^^^^^^^^^ this is the ID
   ```
4. In Settings sheet:
   ```
   Key: OutputFolderId
   Value: 1ABC...XYZ
   ```

### Multiple Tax Profiles

For multi-jurisdiction invoicing:

```json
{
  "HST_ON": 0.13,
  "GST_BC": 0.12,
  "GST_AB": 0.05,
  "QST_QC": 0.14975,
  "NO_TAX": 0
}
```

In Invoice row, set `TaxProfile` to match a key (e.g., `GST_BC`).

## üìû Support & Next Steps

### If Fix Doesn't Work

1. **Check _Logs sheet** for detailed error messages
2. **Run `diagnoseLookup`** function to verify sheet detection
3. **Verify file name** in Apps Script matches exactly: `Invoice.html`
4. **Re-save both files** (CODE.GS and Invoice.html) in Apps Script editor
5. **Refresh the Google Sheet** (reload the page)

### Testing Workflow

```
1. setupWorkbook (one-time)
2. Add test data to sheets
3. diagnoseLookup (verify sheet detection)
4. generateForActiveRow (test PDF generation)
5. Check _Logs for errors
6. Check Drive for PDF file
7. Test email function (optional)
```

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Keep Settings sheet updated with accurate company info
- ‚úÖ Use consistent InvoiceNo format (e.g., PW-YYYY-####)
- ‚úÖ Set Taxable correctly on each line item
- ‚úÖ Verify client email addresses before using email function
- ‚úÖ Check _Logs sheet regularly for issues
- ‚úÖ Backup your sheet before making structural changes
